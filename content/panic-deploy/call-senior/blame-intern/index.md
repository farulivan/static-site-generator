# 😈 The Karma Strike

**Friday, 4:54 PM**

**You**: "Yeah, so Alex changed some config files and completely broke the deployment. I'm trying to clean up their mess but I don't know what they changed."

There's a long pause.

**Sarah**: "Alex is on my team. They're a good intern. What exactly did they change?"

**You**: "Uh, I think they commented out some stuff in the CI config..."

**Sarah**: "Did you review their PR before it merged?"

Your blood runs cold. You were the reviewer. You approved it without looking.

**Sarah**: "I'm looking at the PR now. You approved it. You had one job: review the code. Instead, you're blaming an intern for your mistake?"

**5:10 PM** - Sarah fixes the issue herself  
**5:15 PM** - She posts in #incidents explaining what happened  
**5:16 PM** - She mentions you approved the breaking PR without review

Your manager DMs you: _"We need to talk on Monday."_

## ☠️ Game Over: Karma

You tried to throw an intern under the bus for your own mistake. It backfired spectacularly.
