I'm trying to clean up their mess but I don't know what they changed."</p><p>There's a long pause.</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Alex is on my team. They're a good intern. What exactly did they change?"</p><p><b>You</b>: "Uh, I think they commented out some stuff in the CI config..."</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Did you review their PR before it merged?"</p><p>Your blood runs cold. You were the reviewer. You approved it without looking.</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "I'm looking at the PR now. You approved it. You had one job: review the code. Instead, you're blaming an intern for your mistake?"</p><p><b>5:10 PM</b> - Sarah fixes the issue herself   <b>5:15 PM</b> - She posts in #incidents explaining what happened   <b>5:16 PM</b> - She mentions you approved the breaking PR without review</p><p>Your manager DMs you: <i>"We need to talk on Monday."</i></p><h2>☠️ Game Over: Karma</h2><p>You tried to throw an intern under the bus for your own mistake. It backfired spectacularly.</p><p><b>Ending Stats:</b> - Time to resolution: 21 minutes (Sarah fixed it) - Reputation: -75 (Untrustworthy) - Stress level: Maximum - Career trajectory: Downward ↘️ - Intern's opinion of you: Destroyed - Team trust: Lost</p><p>---</p><h3>What went wrong:
