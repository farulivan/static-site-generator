    <article><div><h1>🎯 The Honest Approach</h1><p><b>Friday, 4:55 PM</b></p><p>You take a breath and explain everything honestly:</p><p><b>You</b>: "Sarah, I deployed without checking staging first. The build is failing with an out-of-memory error. I see that dependencies were updated and the CI config was changed. I'm not sure which is the root cause."</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Okay, good. You're giving me the facts. Pull up the CI logs and read me the exact error."</p><p>You read the error. She thinks for a moment.</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Check the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. Look for memory settings. Someone probably changed them."</p><p>You check. She's right. The memory limit was commented out.</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Uncomment it, bump it to 4GB, and redeploy. That should fix it."</p><p><b>5:02 PM</b> - You make the fix   <b>5:05 PM</b> - Pipeline starts   <b>5:09 PM</b> - Deployment successful! ✅</p><p><b>Sarah</b>: "Good work asking for help. That's what seniors are for. Write up what happened and we'll review it Monday."</p><h2>🎉 Victory: The Mentored</h2><p>You admitted your mistake, asked for help, and learned from someone experienced. This is how you grow.</p><p><b>Ending Stats:</b> - Time to resolution: 18 minutes - Reputation: +45 (Humble and learning) - Stress level: High → Low - Career trajectory: Upward ↗️ - Mentor relationship: Strengthened</p><p>---</p><h3>What you learned:
