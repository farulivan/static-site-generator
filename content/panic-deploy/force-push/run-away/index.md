# 🏃 The Great Escape

**Friday, 4:53 PM**

You stare at the terminal. The Slack notifications are piling up. The CEO is typing.

You make a decision.

You close your laptop.  
You turn off your phone.  
You walk out of your apartment.  
You don't look back.

**Monday, 9:00 AM**

You're in a cabin in Montana. No internet. No phone. Just you, some trees, and a growing sense of dread.

You turn on your phone. 147 missed calls. 892 Slack messages.

The last message from your manager:

_"We need to talk. The company had to bring in consultants. The outage cost $2.3M. Your access has been revoked. Please return your laptop."_

### What went wrong:
- You literally ran away
