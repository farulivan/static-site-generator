# 📞 Calling the Senior Engineer

**Friday, 4:52 PM**

You dial Sarah's number. It rings. And rings. And—

**Sarah**: "Hey, what's up? I'm at my kid's soccer game."

You hear children screaming in the background. You feel terrible. But also, production is down.

**You**: "Sarah, I'm so sorry. Production is down. The deployment failed and I don't know what to do."

There's a pause. You can hear her thinking.

**Sarah**: "Okay. Walk me through what happened. What's the error?"

## 🎯 [Admit your mistake and explain clearly](/panic-deploy/call-senior/admit-mistake)

Be honest. Tell her you deployed without checking the staging environment first. Explain the error. Ask for help like a professional.

## 😈 [Blame the intern](/panic-deploy/call-senior/blame-intern)

"Alex changed some config files and broke everything. I'm just trying to clean up their mess." Throw someone under the bus to save yourself.
