FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed
</code></pre><p>Same error. You restart again. Same error. Again. Same error.</p><p><b>5:15 PM</b> - You've restarted 7 times now.</p><p>Your manager messages you: <i>"Why are you just restarting the runners? What's the actual problem?"</i></p><p>You don't have an answer. You never actually fixed anything.</p><p><b>5:30 PM</b> - The senior engineer takes over. She finds the memory limit issue in 3 minutes. She fixes it in 5.</p><h2>☠️ Game Over: The Restart Loop</h2><p>You wasted 27 minutes clicking "restart" instead of debugging. The issue was never the runners—it was the configuration.</p><p><b>Ending Stats:</b> - Time wasted: 27 minutes - Reputation: -30 (Panic clicker) - Stress level: Maximum - Lesson learned: Restarting is not debugging</p><p>---</p><h3>What went wrong:
- You treated symptoms, not the root cause
- No actual investigation happened
- Wasted time and looked incompetent
- The real fix was simple once someone looked</h3><p><a href="/static-site-generator/start">🔄 Try again</a> | <a href="/static-site-generator/endings">📊 View all endings</a></p></div></article>
