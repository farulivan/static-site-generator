    <article><div><h1>🙏 The Miracle</h1><p><b>Friday, 4:55 PM</b></p><p>You use the admin override. Your hands are shaking as you type:</p><pre><code>git push origin main --force --no-verify --admin-override
</code></pre><p>The terminal shows:</p><pre><code>Bypassing branch protection...
Force pushing to main...
Triggering deployment...
</code></pre><p>You hold your breath. The deployment pipeline starts.</p><p><b>4:57 PM</b> - Build starts...   <b>4:59 PM</b> - Tests... passing?   <b>5:01 PM</b> - Deployment... successful? ✅</p><blockquote><b>#incidents</b>: "Site is back up! What did you do?"</blockquote><p>You check the logs. The revert actually worked. The previous commit was the problem, and reverting it fixed everything.</p><p><b>Pure. Dumb. Luck.</b></p><p>Your manager DMs you: <i>"Next time, don't force push to main. But... good outcome."</i></p><h2>🎉 Victory: The Lucky One</h2><p>You got away with it. The force push worked. The revert was correct. The stars aligned.</p><p><b>Ending Stats:</b> - Time to resolution: 14 minutes - Reputation: +10 (Lucky, not skilled) - Stress level: Maximum → Medium - Career trajectory: Sideways → - Luck used: All of it</p><p>---</p><h3>What you learned:
- Sometimes panic works (but don't rely on it)
- You got lucky this time
- Force pushing to main is still bad
- Document what actually broke</h3><p><b>Warning:</b> This success might make you overconfident. Don't do this again.</p><p><a href="/static-site-generator/start">🏠 Start a new adventure</a> | <a href="/static-site-generator/endings">📊 View all endings</a></p></div></article>
